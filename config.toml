[KingFisher](<https://github.com/coravacav/uofu-cs-discord-bot>) is an opportunistic comedian (RNG) that was written in [Rust](<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>) (the greatest language) for this server (of nerds).
### Commands:
- `/help`: Display this help message.
- `/join_class <course_id>`: Join a class. Gives you the role / access to the channels.
- `/leave_class <course_id>`: Leave a class. Removes the role / access to the channels.
- `/catalog <course_id>`: Get information about a course. Either add a prefix like MATH2240 or CS will be assumed.
- `/reactme`: Allow KingFisher automatic reactions to reply to your messages (including luck)
- `/ignoreme`: Disallow KingFisher automatic reactions to reply to your messages
- `/woof`: Add @Bark role
- `/muzzle`: Remove @Bark role
- `/lynch <user>`: Lynch a user with the Bot React role. 6 yays or nays needed, yay for them, nay for you. You have 90 seconds.
- `/timeout <duration>`: Timeout yourself for a parsable duration (e.g. 1d, 1h, 1m). Discord sets a limit at 4 weeks.
- `/aur <query> <amount>`: Queries the AUR. Can only display the top 20 entries at maximum.

KingFisher also sometimes really likes to react to messages. That's why he replies sometimes (21% rate, unless you're pinging Stefan or typing "luck").

There is a way to force KingFisher to reply to a message. Add "KINGFISHER PLEASE" somewhere in the message to bypass the % chance. Add "HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME" to bypass the cooldown.
